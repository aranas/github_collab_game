# GitHub collab game :cat: :dog:

This repo contains files to be used to practice collaborative version control through GitHub.

Each team will be assigned a text file, which contains an incomplete piece of ASCII art.
The task is to collaboratively complete the ASCII art as fast as possible.
The team to first complete the drawing wins.

Rules are:
- each commit can only contain 1 single character change (except for merge commits)
- You need to add 11 characters to complete the image

Your team will gain  extra points for:
- each sequential commit that did not result in a merge
- each commit with a descriptive commit message
- creativity!
