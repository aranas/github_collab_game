This repo contains files to be used to practice collaborative version control through GitHub.

Each team will be assigned a text file, which contains an incomplete piece of ASCII art.
The task is to complete the ASCII art as fast as possible.
The team to first complete the drawing wins.

The only rule is that each commit can only contain 1 single character change (except for merge commits)

Select extra points for:
- each sequential commit that did not result in a merge conflict
- each commit with a descriptive commit message
- creativity!
